<h3>
	Feast.fm is a music tracking and discovery tool that uses the <a href = "http://www.tomahawk-player.org/">Tomahawk music player </a> to search for music on various content providers. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Feast.fm aims to streamline the process of listening to albums online. Rather than searching for each individual track simply find the album on Feast.fm and let the player find and play the individual tracks. Likewise Feast.fm can be used to find, explore, and listen to entire discographies by artists or labels.
	<br>
	<br>
	Feast.fm also allows you to save songs and albums that you like and to create playlists with the albums and songs that you find. 

	<br>
	<br>

	Lastly, you can follow artists and labels to see their new releases on your Stream.  Click <a href = "/how/"> here</a> for more information on how to use Feast.fm.
	<br>
	<br>

	Feast.fm is a work in progress and is still in the early stages. We welcome feedback - please let us know what you think, what you'd like to see, and if you find any bugs. Contact information can be found <a href="/contact"> here</a>.

	Thanks for reading and happy hunting!
